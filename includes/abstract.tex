Many hours are wasted in front of a red traffic lights in a life time. Every commuter knows this. And with the hours wasted is money lost and are green gases emitted. Many places still deploy very simple constant signal control systems, unable to change and adapt to ever changing conditions. While there exist adaptive control systems, only few cities are able deploy them due to their cost and sensor requirements. In the era of the Internet of Things and Big Data it is possible to have a fully connected signal network, where every signal can base its switching decisions on the knowledge of the entire network.

This paper proposes an approach to accomplish this goal using data driven decision making processes while keeping the number of data source to a minimum.
