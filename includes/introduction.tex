\section{Motivation and Goal}

Every city faces the challange of street and traffic planning and every citizen knows the struggle of driving through the city during rush-hour. Green waves, especially long ones, are a rare phenomen and it usually tends to be a waiting game.
With increasing wait times not only decreases the driver's happiness, but also green-house emitions increase as only very few people own cars that automatically turn off while standing. Even fewer own hybrid or full electric cars.

During less congested hours it also not unlikely to wait in front of red lights for potentially minutes.

These problems can be improved by implementing good traffic light schedules. But what is a \emph{good} schedule?

A good schedule minimize the waiting time (and thus emissions) while maximizing the throughput. This not only the common predictible way, but also when unexpected sudden high traffic situations arise.
