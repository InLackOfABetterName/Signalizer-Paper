We would like to thank our DHBW Supervisor Prof. Dr. Holger Hofmann.

We specifically thank the Peter Berghaus GmbH for kindly sponsoring a copy of the German ''Richtlinien f√ºr Lichtsignalanalagen`` and Norbert Schnippering for the initial contact.

Our sincere thanks also go to family, friends and everyone else who was involved in the process of making the paper.
