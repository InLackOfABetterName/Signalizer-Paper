Traffic light control systems have basically three main problems to solve:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which signals to switch
	\item When to switch signals
	\item How long signals should stay green
\end{enumerate}

Which signals to switch seems to have an obvious answer: All signals red except the street that is allowed to drive. In the real world however, the answer is not that simple. In order to maximize the throughput as many streets as possible should allow vehicles to drive. Considering traffic priority other rules makes this a complex problem. In the best case, all signals would be green and thus making traffic signals obsolete as seen in free-flow highway interchanges, because there the streets do not cross each other on the same level. In intersections save driving must be guaranteed by the signal control system. So there is a trade off required between throughput (all signals green / no signals at all) and driver safety (only one green signal at any given time).

In an unrestricted intersection of two streets (see \autoref{unrestricted_intersection}), a vehicle can enter from one of four directions and can leave the intersection in any of the three remaining directions (ignoring u-turns). That makes $4 \times 3 = 12$ different traffic lights, if every way through the intersection would be signaled separately, which is the case in larger intersections. All possible groups of signals would be given by the power set of the twelve different signals, which gives $2^{12} = 4096$ different groups. Finding the desired set signal groups can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem which grows exponentially with the number of signals in the intersection.

The second problem, deciding when to switch a certain signal group, is the main problem of this paper. Signal switching generally introduces overhead and reduces the throughput, so the amount of switches should be minimized. At the same time having to long phases will increase the latency (driver wait time) for other streets. This is also part of the third problem, how much time each phase gets. This is an optimization problem between maximizing the throughput on congested streets while still keeping the waiting times on other streets on an acceptable level. This is especially hard if two congested streets intersect.

- Neural networks. Is there a pattern how to  generate the neural network? Should it grow on its own? What type of neural network do we need?

- Stress level. Is there already something like the stress level algorithm. Growth of stress level. Can set up a algorithm that builds the perfect stress level for certain inputs? On what level do we have to set up the stress level calculation? Maybe whole streets? What parameters go into the algorithm? Limits for stress levels for the switching of the lights. Can we stick to the idea of green waves with our stress level algorithm? Can we explicitly make green waves? Is our algorithm better than a static signal wiring, if we just calculate it with perfect predictions? How much worse does it get if the predictions are off? Can we make the algorithm even better after we did the calculation examples. Idea: We should probably split off our stress level calculator to be able to monitor other signal wirings. I think the stress level growth algorithm really has to be more or less perfect. It is our metric to determine later if our prototype is better than existing solutions. Maybe compare signal wirings that we know are better and worse with the stress level algorithm and show empirically that our algorithm is good. Does the stress level approach have disadvantages? Are there other metrics? Maybe this and the neural networks stuff have to be separate chapters? This would also make the titling of the chapters less generic, which I think is good and the work could be split up effectively. Maybe the system deciding on the signals that should be changed can not even find the optimal solution in reasonable time. The system is split up in two phases one that calculates stress levels and one that the signals. Maybe the calculation of the stress levels should even work with events in the end. When a traffic light switches from red to green it sends events to the next node and then the new stress level calculation for the traffic light is executed. This is too detailed for this chapter, but I think the idea is good.

- Exploration of different street intersections. Maybe in the sense of inputs for a neural network, because the input nodes and stuff should be generated by the application for every possible crossing. Are there especially challenging street crossings to implement? Does there have to be different stress level algorithms for different crossings?
