- German guidelines for traffic signals (Richtlinien fÃ¼r Lichtsignalanlagen (RiLSA))

- Different traffic light sensors (accuracy, features, can they measure the number of vehicles?, how is the data accessible?, how widely used are ones that are accessible over the internet currently?)

- Neural networks, but details on that have to be read up first (The general idea must be explained in the introduction really well. Why did we choose neural networks?)

- Maybe some statistical data analysis method for defining the optimal stress levels to switch signals and stress level growth?

- Open Street Maps (what data can they carry? can we use them for our endeavor?)

-> Should we introduce all these topics when they are important? Maybe have just some basic stuff here like german guidelines, traffic light sensors and neural networks? The choice of Open Street Maps may need to be explained in more detail.
